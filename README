What changed over the last 3 revisions

=over

=item 0.19	Thursday 13th September, 2007

	Don't use _CvGV to determine if a sub was imported, there's a handy
	flag - GVf_IMPORTED_CV.  Fixes 5.9.5 and future perls
	(solution by Nicholas Clark)



=item 0.18    Friday 4th August, 2006

	Rewrite _CvGV in terms of B::CV - no xs dependency anymore
	(suggested by Tim Bunce)

        Add the (FETCH|MODIFY)_$foo_ATTRIBUTES methods to the private
	stoplists. (rt #12451)

        Support documentation where the method name is documented in a
	::qualified style (rt #14635)

	Ignores new (5.8) magic CLONE and CLONE_SKIP methods. (rt #17489)

	Added a nonwhitespace option (Alex - rt #14950)



=item 0.17	Tuesday 23rd November, 2004

	Fixed a further case reported by Jos Boumans where
    	=head2 $self->foo(); was intepreted as documentation for a
        C<foo()> method.  (more XS4ALL house style)

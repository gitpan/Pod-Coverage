=item 0.12	Tuesday 30th September, 2003

	Added 'trustme' so that you don't have to lie about subs being private
	when the module fails to find their docs.  Work by David Cantrell.

	Pulled HISTORY out into a Changes file.

	Deprecated and gutted Pod::Coverage::Overloader.  The ignored
	patterns in the base class now include qr/^\(/ which is all it
	really did only in a stupidly complex manner.
